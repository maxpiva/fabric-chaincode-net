# fabric-chaincode-net


[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/72hk6ank8wc9m27o?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maxpiva/fabric-chaincode-net)

v1.3

Direct .NET port from [fabric-chaincode-java](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-java)

`Very Alpha`

Porting is done and basic unit tests are passing.


Need to figure out how to integrate this in [fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric)
and then integrating the .net chaincode source and/or compiled uploads into [.NET SDK](https://github.com/maxpiva/fabric-sdk-net)

Help is appreciated since i'm not proficient in GO language

TODO:
* Peer Mock needs to be ported, to finalize integration tests.
* Examples
